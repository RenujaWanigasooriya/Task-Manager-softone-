# Task Management Application

This repository contains a minimal full-stack example with a .NET Web API backend and an Angular frontend.

- `backend/` – ASP.NET Core Web API for managing tasks.
- `frontend/` – Angular application for interacting with the API.

Both projects are intentionally lightweight and may require additional setup for production use.

**For more details, please refer the Readme file int he Backend and Frontend folders**
