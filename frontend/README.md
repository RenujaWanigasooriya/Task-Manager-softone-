# Task Manager Frontend

This folder contains a minimal Angular application that communicates with the TaskManager API.

## Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- Angular CLI

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application expects the API to be available at `/api` relative to the dev server.
